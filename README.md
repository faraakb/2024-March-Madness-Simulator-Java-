● Semi-realistic simulator of the 2024 March Madness Tourney
● Utilized Java and object-oriented programming techniques such as inheritance, along with data (probabilities of each team's advance to the next round) to get results from all 64 participating teams.
● Made use of data structures like HashMap’s to make the expansive collection of data look seamless as the simulation runs.
